# COD is still king in SEA, but failed delivery kills margin.

Most social sellers accept COD because it converts better than prepay. The downside is returned parcels, fake addresses, and high courier re-delivery cost.  
This playbook is designed for a small team handling orders from chat + walk-in at the same time.

## 1) Use a 3-step order confirmation

Before packing, confirm:

1. full name
2. phone number
3. district/province + nearest landmark

If a customer replies slowly, mark order as `Pending Confirm` and do not ship yet.

## 2) Score risk before shipping

Use a simple rule:

- `Low Risk`: repeat buyer, complete address, responsive
- `Medium Risk`: first order, complete address
- `High Risk`: incomplete address, no response, previous returns

Ship `Low` and `Medium` same day, but require manual approval for `High`.

## 3) Standardize address format

Make every order follow one structure:

`Name | Phone | House No. | Village | District | Province | Note`

This reduces courier mistakes and speeds up label printing.

## 4) Set courier cut-off per day

Many teams lose orders because they accept all-day promise.  
Define cut-off clearly, for example:

- orders confirmed before 15:00 => ship today
- after 15:00 => ship next business day

Clear SLA reduces customer disputes.

## 5) Send pre-delivery reminder

A short reminder message 1 day before delivery can reduce refusal:

`Your parcel is arriving tomorrow (COD). Please keep your phone available.`

## 6) Track reason codes for failed COD

Do not just mark "failed". Track exact reason:

- unreachable phone
- wrong address
- customer rejected
- moved out

Within 2-3 weeks you will see pattern and fix root causes faster.

## 7) Review COD performance weekly

Use one dashboard with 4 metrics:

- total COD shipped
- delivered rate
- return rate
- top failed reason

Weekly review with your ops team for 15 minutes is enough to keep improvement moving.

## How AstroPOS supports this workflow

- centralize orders from Facebook, WhatsApp, and walk-in
- auto-structure customer data from pasted chat messages
- tag risky buyers from order history
- monitor delivery outcome in one status timeline

If you apply the full playbook consistently, most small shops can reduce avoidable COD returns within the first month.
