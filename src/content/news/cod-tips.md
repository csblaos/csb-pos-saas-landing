# Cash on Delivery (COD) is a double-edged sword.

While it increases conversion, it also increases risk. Here are 5 tips to reduce returns:

1. **Call to confirm**: Always call new customers before shipping.
2. **Check Blacklist**: Use our *Customer History* feature to see if they have rejected parcels before.
3. **Send SMS**: Notify them on the day of delivery.
