# New system adoption fails when training is unclear.

Most launch issues are not technical. They come from inconsistent daily behavior across staff shifts.

Use this 5-day checklist to reduce go-live friction.

## Day 1: account access and role setup

- create user accounts by role
- assign permissions for sales, packing, and manager
- test sign-in on mobile and desktop

## Day 2: order intake simulation

- run 20 sample orders from social and walk-in
- verify customer data consistency
- enforce status updates after each step

## Day 3: packing and shipping drill

- print labels for all sample orders
- test courier handover flow
- audit packing accuracy with random checks

## Day 4: payment and COD handling

- practice COD reconciliation process
- validate paid, pending, and refunded statuses
- align finance and operations handoff

## Day 5: incident response

Train the team on common incidents:

- duplicate order
- out-of-stock after confirmation
- wrong address reported by courier
- customer cancellation after pack

Each incident should have:

- owner
- first action
- escalation path

## Keep these rules visible

- no status update, no handover
- no address verification, no shipping
- no end-of-day report, no shift close

Clear operating rules turn training into repeatable execution.
