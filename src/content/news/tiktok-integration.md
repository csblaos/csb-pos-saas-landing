# Sell on TikTok Shop? We got you.

We are excited to announce our direct integration with **TikTok Shop**. Now you can:

1. Sync inventory in real-time.
2. Print shipping labels directly from AstroPOS.
3. Track COD status without opening the TikTok app.

## How to enable

Go to Settings > Channels > TikTok and click **Connect**.
