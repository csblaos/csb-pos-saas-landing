# Going live on TikTok Shop is easy. Running it daily is the real challenge.

Most issues happen after launch day: overselling, delayed replies, and missing order status updates.  
This guide focuses on what to set up in the first 7 days so your team can keep up with volume.

## Day 1: connect channel and verify account mapping

1. Connect TikTok Shop in channel settings.
2. Confirm store currency and timezone.
3. Map payment statuses to your internal status flow.

If your timezone is wrong, same-day dispatch reports will be inaccurate.

## Day 2: configure inventory source of truth

Choose one source of stock truth:

- either AstroPOS stock is primary
- or external ERP is primary

Do not allow both sides to update freely.  
This prevents quantity mismatch during flash traffic.

## Day 3: test order intake from all entry points

Run test cases:

- one TikTok order
- one Facebook order
- one WhatsApp manual order

Confirm all appear in one queue with clear channel labels.

## Day 4: shipping and label process

Set rules for:

- same-day packaging cut-off
- preferred courier per region
- fallback courier when first option unavailable

Print 10 test labels and verify address format before high volume days.

## Day 5: response SLA for customer support

Define clear service-level targets:

- first reply within 5 minutes in business hours
- order issue resolution within 1 hour

Even great ad performance fails when post-sale response is slow.

## Day 6: finance and COD reconciliation

Check daily:

- total paid orders vs shipped orders
- COD expected vs COD settled
- refund and cancel ratio

This keeps finance and ops aligned from early stage.

## Day 7: team retrospective and fixes

Do a short review:

- top 3 blockers this week
- top 3 fixes to ship next week

Small weekly improvements beat large monthly overhauls.

## Recommended KPI baseline (first 30 days)

- order sync accuracy >= 99%
- stock mismatch <= 1%
- late dispatch <= 5%
- first response SLA >= 90%

Once these numbers are stable, you can scale ad spend with much lower operational risk.
