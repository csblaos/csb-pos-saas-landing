# Most small teams do not have a sales problem. They have a queue problem.

When Facebook, WhatsApp, and walk-in orders are handled in separate places, teams lose time switching context and miss fulfillment cut-off.

This setup guide shows a lightweight approach that works for teams with 2 to 10 staff.

## Step 1: define one order intake format

Every order should include:

- channel source
- customer name and phone
- item + quantity
- payment method
- delivery mode

No format, no processing.

## Step 2: assign ownership by stage, not by channel

Avoid "Facebook staff" vs "WhatsApp staff".  
Use stage-based ownership:

- intake and verification
- packing
- handover to courier
- post-delivery follow-up

This balances workload during traffic spikes.

## Step 3: use status rules everyone understands

Recommended minimal statuses:

- New
- Pending Confirm
- Ready to Pack
- Shipped
- Completed
- Failed

Keep the list short and enforce transitions.

## Step 4: reserve stock at confirmation point

Once an order is confirmed, reserve stock immediately.  
This avoids overselling when two channels sell the same SKU at the same time.

## Step 5: publish a packing SLA board

Example:

- New to Ready to Pack: within 30 minutes
- Ready to Pack to Shipped: within 2 hours

Visible SLA board increases team accountability.

## Step 6: review error log daily

Track these avoidable errors:

- wrong phone
- duplicate order
- incorrect SKU
- late handover

Fixing repeat errors is the fastest way to increase daily throughput.

## Suggested weekly KPI

- average processing time per order
- packing accuracy
- same-day shipping rate
- return rate by channel

With one unified queue, most teams see improved speed within 1-2 weeks.
